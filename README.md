## SCALAR-VI CANSAT *Ardan*

## Description
Code and schematics of the cansat aboard SCALAR-VI made with students of the Jules Verne middleschool in Carcassone, FR.

## Installation
The ‘RadioHead’ library used to manage the LoRaWAN depends on “stdatomic”, we need to change the source code of ‘RadioHead’ to source the correct implementation for Arduino vs. ESP.
